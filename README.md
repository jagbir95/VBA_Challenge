## Summary
### Advantages
- Refactoring is the key part when you are writing a code. It makes the code more efficient. In addition to this you can read and understand the code very easily.
- With some restructure the original script became very helpful. Now we can do the analysis on multiple years with just one code. 
### Disadvantages
- The only disadvantage is that it takes time to do the refactoring. If you are not familiar with the code there are higher chances to make mistakes and your code will show errors while debugging.
- The original script was good but we had to do the analysis on each worksheet manually. which is not helpful when analysis needed to be done repeatedly on different years.  
- The code run time of all stocks analysis [2017](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KKZkmuGBxxGOiV1v9X2jFBfXAFOy8pY_/view?usp=sharing) and [2018](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l_aV8sIxPtJGPcwk_EZ7Xf37yK-QCseJ/view?usp=sharing) increased after refactoring as compared to the [original script](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hX72axsgEYabs5sHJ3_3JSqiJQk9zTWk/view?usp=sharing) run time.
